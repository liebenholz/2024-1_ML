## Lecture Introduction
All projects and assignments are based on [**'2024 Spring Machine Learning(2)'**](https://knu-p4c-lab.github.io/lectures/bb2bca2d-537e-5332-82b1-cf8f07ca885b/) by KNU P4C Lab.
### Notice
[240416]
- **['Individual Assignment #3'](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2024-knu-ml-ind-asmt3) has been invalidated**, due to some students cheating on model training with public dataset. Unfair result might occur by leaking of evaluation set, so all participants in Kaggle Competition got a full-score(9/9) from 'Individual Assignment #3'.

[240422]
- From now on, all students should follow the [.ipynb template](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BWC3u2pijI48jpgaoxy4vkn3f5i6U_v8?usp=sharing). Also, all students must have a same result with a submitted jupyter notebook and Kaggle Competition final score.
